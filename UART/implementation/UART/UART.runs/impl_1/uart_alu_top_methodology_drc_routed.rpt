There is a large setup violation of -1.223 ns between uart_unit/baud_rate_gen/r_reg_reg[5]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and uart_unit/fifo_rx_unit/array_reg_reg_0_3_6_7__0/DP/WE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
